# Personal Portfolio Website

Hey! This is my first portfolio website that I built for my Introduction to ICT course assignment. I'm a first-semester Computer Science student at NUCES, and this is one of my first web development projects!

**Course**: Introduction to Information and Communication Technologies  
**Assignment**: Assignment 1  
**University**: National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NUCES)  
**Semester**: Fall 2025

You can see my website live here: [https://arham-shahid.github.io/portfolio-website/](https://arham-shahid.github.io/portfolio-website/)

## What's in this website?

I've created 6 pages for this assignment:

- **Home Page** - Just a simple intro about me and links to other pages
- **Personal Profile** - My profile picture and a bit about my background
- **Career Goals** - Where I want to be in the short-term and long-term
- **Projects** - Some of the projects I've worked on (mostly C++ stuff I'm learning)
- **Skills** - What I know so far, shown with progress bars
- **Contact Us** - A form where people can reach out to me

## What I learned

This was my first time building a complete website! I learned:

- How to structure HTML pages
- Styling with CSS (still learning, but getting better!)
- Basic JavaScript for form validation and animations
- How to deploy a website using GitHub Pages

## Technologies I used

- **HTML** - For the structure of the pages
- **CSS** - To make it look nice (I used Flexbox which was new to me)
- **JavaScript** - For the contact form validation and animating the progress bars

## How to run it locally

If you want to see it on your computer:

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Just open `index.html` in your browser - that's it! No fancy setup needed.

## About me

I'm Muhammad Arham, a first-semester CS student. I'm really interested in Machine Learning and I'm currently learning C++. This website is part of my learning journey, and I'm excited to keep building more projects!
